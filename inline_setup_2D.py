class InlineScanningSetup2D:
    """
    This class represents a Compute Tomography (CT) inline scanning setup composed of a fixed X-ray source and detector
    for imaging objects passing on a conveyor belt.
    Attributes
    ---------
    geometry_matrix : ndarray
        It holds the position of each element (object, X-ray source, and detector) in a vector space at each projection
        acquisition. The data is encapsulated according to the specifications of ASTRA Toolbox.
    Methods
    -------
    get_geometry_matrix()
        Returns the geometry_matrix built by the class constructor.
